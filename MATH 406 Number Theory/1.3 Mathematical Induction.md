# Proof by Contradiction
- `Original Statement`
- 1 step: Negate `Original Statement`
- 2 step: Make an conclusion by solving it.
	- If negation is TRUE, the original statement is FALSE
	- If negation is FALSE, the original statement is TRUE


# Proof by Mathematical Induction

We follow these 5 steps:
1. Let $P(n)$ the given statement
2. Base Case
	- Show $P(n)$ is TRUE for least element $n$
		- Ex: $P(n)$ for $n\geq 0$, so show $P(0)$ is TRUE
		- LHS = RHS
3. Indunction Hypothesis `I. H`
	- Suppose $P(k)$ is TRUE
4. Claim
	- $P(k+1)$
5. Prove Claim
	- Prove $P(k+1)$ is TRUE for every $k \geq 0$
	- We use $P(k)$ to prove Claim
		- We start from `I. H` $P(k)$ and construct until $P(k+1)$ is TRUE
