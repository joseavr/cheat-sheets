# Congruences 

- There are three ways to describe congruence modulo 
-  $a \equiv b (mod n)$
	1. `a` and `b` have the same `remainder` when they are divided by `n`
		- n must be `n > 1`
	2.  $a = k*n + b$
		- Useful when doing some equations
	3. $n | (a-b)$
		- Useful when doing some proofs

# Examples

-  $10 \equiv 14 (mod 4)$
	1. $\frac{10}{4} = 2$ with Remainder 2
	2. $10 = k*4 + 14$
	3. $4 |      (10 -14)$
