# üé¨ Intro to Limit on Comparison Sorting

- Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, HeapSort, and Quick Sort are all **based on making comparisons**.
- Sometimes we shift, sometimes we swap
- ComparisonSort is better than CountingSort, when k (max integer) is big
- CountingSort is better than ComparisonSort, when k (max integer) is smaller

# üå≤ Intro to Decision Tree

Fastest comparison-based sorting algorithm, worst-case time complexity:
$$T (n) = Œò(n lg n)$$
Is there some sorting algorithm with better (smaller) time complexity $Œò(n lg n)$?

# ü´µ Decisions
- Comparisons lead to decisions such as ‚ÄúIf X > Y do this, otherwise do that‚Äù. 
- There always a minimum number of decisions that the algorithm must make. Consider these examples of lists and sorting them.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Example
- Suppose list = [X,Y] needs to be sorted.

- Done, array sorted.


## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Example
- Suppose list = [X,Y,Z] needs to be sorted.

We can rebuild the decisions as a **Binary Tree**:

# Decisions Tree for an Algorithm

```python
# Bubble Sort
for i = 0 to n-1
    for j = 0 to n-i-2
        if A[j] <= A[j+1]
            nothing
        else
            swap A[j] and A[j+1]
```

Let‚Äôs see how this works on a list of length 3, BubbleSort will check...
- Is A[0] < A[1]? Swap if false.  
- Is A[1] < A[2]? Swap if false.  
- Is A[0] < A[1] again? Swap if false.

We see that we have a List = [X,Y,Z]. There are 3 possible comparisson in the tree:
- X < Y
- Y < Z
- X < Z

There are six possible ways that the data might be related:
**Note**: `Automatically true` won't appear in the tree

1. If X < Y < Z then starting with A = [X, Y, Z], BubbleSort will check...
- Is A[0] < A[1], meaning X < Y? True.  
- Is A[1] < A[2], meaning Y < Z? True.  
- Is A[0] < A[1], meaning X < Y? Automatically true.

2. If X < Z < Y then starting with A = [X, Y, Z], BubbleSort will check...
- Is A[0] < A[1], meaning X < Y? True.  
- Is A[1] < A[2], meaning Y < Z? False. Swap. Now A=[X,Z,Y]
- Is A[0] < A[1], meaning X < Z? True.

3. If Z < X < Y then starting with A = [X, Y, Z], BubbleSort will check...
- Is A[0] < A[1], meaning X < Y? True  
- Is A[1] < A[2], meaning Y < Z? False. Swap. Now A = [X,Z,Y]
- Is A[0] <¬†A[1], meaning X < Z? False. Swap. Now A = [Z,X,Y]

4. If Y < X < Z then starting with A = [X, Y, Z], BubbleSort will check...
- Is A[0] < A[1], meaning X < Y? False. Swap. Now A = [Y,X,Z]
- Is A[1] < A[2], meaning X < Z? True.  
- Is A[0] < A[1], meaning Y < X? Automatically true.

5. If Y < Z < X then starting with A = [X, Y, Z], BubbleSort will check...
- Is A[0] < A[1], meaning X < Y? False. Swap. Now A = [Y,X,Z]
- Is A[1] < A[2], meaning X < Z? False. Swap. Now A = [Y,Z,X]
- Is A[0] < A[1], meaning Y < Z? True.

6. If Z < Y < X then starting with A = [X, Y, Z], BubbleSort will check...
- Is A[0] < A[1], meaning X < Y? False. Swap. Now A = [Y,X,Z]
- Is A[1] < A[2], meaning X < Z? False. Swap. Now A = [Y,Z,X]
- Is A[0] < A[1], meaning Y < Z? False. Swap. Now A = [Z,Y,X]

- **Note**: at each branch (left hand as example), it must have the 3 possible comparissons
	- X < Y
	- Y < Z
	- X < Z

# Theorems
Assume $n$ is the Array size

- The total number of Leaves is:
$$Leaves = n!$$
- The Shortest Path to a Leaf is:
$$shortestPath_{\rightarrow leaf} = n - 1$$
- If $h$ is the height of the tree, then # of Leaves is at most $2^{h}$
$$n! \leq 2^{h}$$
$$h \geq \log_{2}(n!)$$


# Analysis of Comparison-Based Sorting

- Any comparison sort requires, in the worst-case, $Œ©(nlgn)$ comparisons
$$Number\_comparisons = Œ©(nlgn)$$
