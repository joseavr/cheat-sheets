# 🎬 Intro to Floyd
- Called "All pairs shortest paths"
- Floyd applies to **weighted** and **directed/undirected** graphs
- Floyd applies to **unweighted** and **directed/undirected** graphs
- Floyd is optimal (all distances returned are minimal)


# ⏳ Running Time

- `Worst Case`
	- $Θ\left( V^{3}  \right)$
	- No matter how many Edges
- `Best Case`
	- $Θ\left(   \right)$
- `Average Case`
	- $Θ\left(   \right)$

# ⌛️ Space Time
- $Θ \left(   \right)$

# 🤷🏻‍♂️ What is Floyd
Also called "All pairs shortest paths." Returns the length of the shortest path between any pair of vertices, including how to recover the path
# Pseudocode
```python

```

```python

```

- `Floyd Recurrence`
$$T(n) = here $$
- `Best Case`
$$T(n) = here$$
- `Worst Case`
$$T(n) = here$$
