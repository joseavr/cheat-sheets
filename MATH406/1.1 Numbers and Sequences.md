# Intro 
* Set Notations:
	* Set of Natural Numbers: 
		* $\mathbb{N}$ = {$1, 2, 3 \dots$}
	- Set of Integers: 
		- $\mathbb{Z}$ = {$\dots, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$}
		- $\mathbb{Z^+}$ = {$1, 2, 3, \dots$}
		- $\mathbb{Z^-}$ = {$\dots, -2, -1$}
	- Set of rational Numbers: 
		- $\mathbb{Q}$ = {$\frac{a}{b} \mid a,b \in \mathbb{Z}; b \neq 0$}  
		- Irrational = sets that cannot be written as a ratio of two integers (decimal form)
	- Set of Real Numbers: 
		- $\mathbb{R}$ = any number that is rational or irrational
	- Set of Complex Numbers: 
		- $\mathbb{C}$ = real part + imaginary part

# The Well-Ordering Property 
- Every nonempty set of $\mathbb{Z^+}$ has ==a least element==
- Example: 
	- Set of $\mathbb{Z^+}$ has a least element "1", thus it's well-ordered
	- Set of $\mathbb{Z^-}$ doesn't have a least element, thus it's not well-ordered


# Rational Numbers
- Definition:
	- The real number $r$ is $rational$ if there are integers $p$ and $q$, with $q \neq 0$, s.t $\frac{p}{q} = r$
	- If $r$ is not $rational$, then it's said $irrational$
	
- Theorem: $\sqrt{ 2 }$ is irrational
