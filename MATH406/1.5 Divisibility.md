# Relative Prime
- `Definition`: 
	- The integers a and b, with $a \neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$, are relatively prime if $a$ and $b$ have ==a greatest common divisor== $gcd(a,b) = 1$
- Two numbers are relatively prime 
	- If the only number that divides them evenly is 1.

Follow these steps:
1. List all numbers $< n$
2. Decompose $n$
	- Ex: $n = 10 = 2 * 5$
3. Eliminate all decomposed factors
4. The left set is relative prime to $n$
