# 🎬 Intro to OCAML
- Ocaml checks data types at `compile time`
- OCaml uses `static` and `latent typing`
- To minimize **side effects**, Variables in OCaml are `immutable`
- Since variables are immutable, they cannot be overwritten by variables
	- Once a variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed
	
```ocaml
let x = 5;;
print_int x;; (* Output: 5 *)

x = 10;; (* Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type unit *)
```
- In Ocaml, almost everything is an expression
	- **All values are expressions, but not all expressions are values**
	- The only thing that is not an expression is the `let binding`, such as
```ocaml
let binding:
let x = 5 in
let y = x + 2 in
print_int y


let expression:
let square x = 
	let y = x * x in 
	y + 1
```

## OCAML ENV
- ocaml: `repl` like `irb`
- utop: like `ocaml` but better
- `dune` like `Make`
- `opam` package manager for OCaml
- To run
	- `dune utp src`
# Declarative vs Imperative

## Imperative
- Programmer specifies the exact sequence of steps that the program should take to achieve its goal
- Describes control flow
- Such as for loops 

```ruby
# imperative.rb
results = []
arr.each{|item|
	remainder = item % 2 
	if remainder == 0
		results.push(0)
	end
}
results
```

## Declarative
- Programmer specifies what the program should achieve, rather than how to achieve it.
- Such as Array methods in JS
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
```

# Side Effects
Side effects are changes that occur as a result of executing a code block. These changes may include modifications to variables or objects outside of the function scope, changes to the state of the program, or even external systems such as files or networks.

Side effects can cause several problems in programming such as
- Debugging issues  
- Predictability  
- Readability and maintainability  
-  Testing

## Example
$f ( x ) + f ( x ) + f ( x ) = 3 * f ( x )$

- However, if we run the code above, then 
- $f(x) + f(x) + f(x) = 1 + 2 + 3$ and $3 * f(x) = 3 * 1$. 
- This unpredictability is called a side effect 
- The true definition of a side effect is when non local variables get modified

# Expression in OCAML
- In OCaml, we say that almost everything is an expression
- All values are expressions in and of themselves, but not all expressions are values.


```ocaml
(* expressions.ml *)
true (* is a value, has type bool *)
3 * 4 (* is an expression, has type int *)
"hello" ^ "world" (* is an expression of type string *)
5.4 (* a value of type float *)
```

- There are things not consider an expression: the binding of expressions to variables
- A `let`binding is not an expression and just binds an expression to a variable. Here is an example:
```ocaml
(* letBinding.ml *)
let x = 3 + 4
(* syntax *)
(* let variable = e*)
```

- A let expression is like setting a local variable to be used in another expression
```ocaml
(* letExpression.ml *)
let x = 3 + 4 in x + 1 
(* syntax *) 
(* let variable = e1 in e2 *)
```

- Since immutable in OCaml, variables are overwritten.

```ocaml
(* scoping.ml *)
let x = 3 in let y = 4 in x + y (* 7 *)
let x = 3 in let x = 4 in x (* 4 *)
let x = 3 in let z = 4 + x in let x = 1 in x + z (* 8 *) 

(* implicit parenthesis *)
let x = 3 in (let z = 4 + x in (let x = 1 in x + z))
```

- Another kind of expressions
```ocaml
let x = if true then false else true in let y = 3 + 4 in let z = if true then 2 else 6 in if x then y else z
```

```ocaml
(* implicit parenthesis *) 
let x = (if true then false else true) in let y = (3 + 4) in let z = (if true then 2 else 6) in (if x then y else z)
```

## The IF expression

```ocaml
(* RULE FOR IF EXPRESSIONS*)
( if e1:bool then e2:t e3:t ):t (* where t : datatype and e : expressions*)
```
- e1 must evaluate to `bool`
- e2 and e3 must be the same datatype `t`

## Valid Expressions
- Unlike Ruby or other programming languages,
	- `true` and `false` or expressions that evaluate to `true` or `false` are only allowed in `if`
```ocaml
if true then 3 else 4

if true then false else true

if 3 < 4 then 5 + 6 else 7 + 8

if (if true then false else true) then (if false then 3 else 4) else (if true then 5 else 6)
```

- We can use `let` bindings and `let` expressions
```ocaml
let x = if true then false else true
let y = 3 + 4 - 10 in if true then y else y + 10
```

## Invalid Expressions

```ocaml
if 3 then 4 else 5
```

# The Function expression

- In ruby,
```ruby
x = 3
puts x 3
```

```ruby
def x 
	3
end
puts x
```

- In Ocaml,
```ocaml
(* functions.ml *)
let area l w = l * w 
(* or to use a let expression where we call the function *)
let area l w = l * w in area 2 3

(* syntax *)
(*  (let name e1:t1 e2:t2 ... ex:tx = e:ty):t1 -> t2 -> tx -> ty  *)
```

# Chaining
- The order of evaluation is "left-to-right"
```ocaml
let x = 1 in let x = x+2 in let x = x+3 in x

(* returns 6 *)
```

- It is equivalent to
```ocaml
 let x = 1 in let y = x+2 in let z = y+3 in z;;
```

- Can be rewriten as
```ocaml
(fun x -> let x=x+2 in let x=x+3 in x) 1
```

- Which is the same as
```ocaml
let x=1 in let y=x+2 in let z=y+3 in z
```
