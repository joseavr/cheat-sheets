# Introduction

Data Visualization is the process to create graphical representation of data.
- Used to represent data as graphs. 
- Discover trends and patterns of data. 
- Summarize information

A good visualization must be arranged logically (e.g y-axis starting at 0)

What visualization for? 
- To explore data in a intuitive way
- communicate very easy to others

# Design Distribution

- Visualization should be design to communicate specific insight or more.
- Maximize information and minimize ink.
- Organize hierarchically. Start broad then zoom in
- Dazzle. Brighten a person that is not aware.

## 1. Information
Collecting the correct and required data

## 2. Story
Providing context of why data matters and suggesting actions. They are a bridge between data and audience. A story that makes sense the statistics.

`Act 1 - Setup`: get the audience interested in the data, with a simple summary, broader information to later narrow it to complext and more detailed information

`Act 2 - Conflict`: Explore the issues, slicing each problem, looking data different ways. Use charts to help people to understand the issues.

`Act 3 - Resolution`: Make the audience feel the protagonist. Inspire audience to act. Answers audience's questions

## 3. Goal
Define the data's purpose and choose the right charts and techniques aligned with the goal for effective data analysis and decision-making.


## 4. Visual Form
Presentation of the visualization
