# x86

## What is a Compiler

It is basically a function, `input -> output`.

Typically, `source-program -> target-program`.

Well known compilers

| compiler  | source-program | target-program |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| gcc, lang | C              | Binary         |
| v8        | Javascript     | Binary         |
| nasm      | x86            | Binary         |
| pdftex    | LaTex          | PDF            |

## What is x86

An assembly programming language, whose interpreter implemented in CPU.

x86_64 is a 64-bit version, 16 registers (64-bit):

- rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rbp, rsp, rsi, rdi, r8, r9, ... , r15

Our goal is: Translate from high-level programming (Racket) to low level assembly (x86).

Working with a small subset of x86 (called a86), the compiler will target a86, which from a86 to x86 becomes simple.

x86 program example:

```x86
global entry   // wrapper of the program or starting poitn
default rel
section .text  // from this section, there's code
entry:
mov rbx, 36    // put 36 to rbx (pretty fast register / memory)
tri:
  cmp rbx, 0   // rbx = 0?
  je done      // if rbx = 0 then jump to 'done' else continue to next line
  push rbx     // push rbx to stack
  sub rbx, 1   // rbx - 1
  call tri     // recursively call tri()
               // stack: 36, 35, 34, ...
  pop rbx
  add rax, rbx
  ret
done:
  mov rax, 0 // rax is a register used only for returning values
  ret
```

**Explanation:**
This code pushes to stack: 36, 35, ... , 0.

When it reaches to 0, the program jumps to `done` then jumps to `pop` and terminates by returning the value stored in `rax`

# a86

a86 is a small subset of x86.

```a86
// a86
(Mov 'rax 10)
```

```x86
// x86
mov rax 10
```

The good part, we can write a86 with Racket.

## Mov

Move a value to a register.

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asn-display
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)
    (Mov 'rbx 42)     //  move value 42 to register rbx
    (Mov 'rax 'rbx)   //  set 42 to rax to be returned
    (Ret)
    )
)
```

Another tricky example:

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asn-display
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)
    (Mov 'rbx 42)     //  move value 42 to register rbx
    (Mov 'rbx 'rax)   //  rax always intialized to 0, set 0 to rbx
    (Ret)
    )
)
```

## Add, Sub

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)
    (Mov 'rbx 32)     // rbx = 32
    (Mov 'rax 'rbx)   // rax = rbx
    (Add 'rax 10)     // rax = 32 + 10
    (Ret)     // returns rax = 42
  )
)
```

## And

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)
    (Move 'entry)
    (Mov 'rax 9) # 1 0 0 1
    (And 'rax 3) # 0 0 1 1
                 # 0 0 0 1  -> 2^0 = 1
    (Ret)        # returns rax = 1
  )
)
```

## Xor

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)
    (Mov 'rax 9)  # 1 0 0 1
    (Xor 'rax 7)  # 0 1 1 1
                  # 1 1 1 0  -> 14
    (Ret)   # returns rax = 14
  )
)
```

## Not

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)
    (Mov 'rax 9) # 0000 1001
    (Not 'rax)   # 1111 0110 -> -10  how to calcualate?

                # 0000 1001
                #         1+
                # 0000 1010 -> 10 -> -10
    (Ret)
  )
)
```

## Sal: Shift to left

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)
    (Mov 'rax 4)    # ... 0000 0000 0100
    (Sal 'rax 6)    #           ... 0100 000000 (delete 6 bits on left & add 6 bits of 0's on the right)

    (Ret)   # -> ... 0001 0000 0000
  )
)
```

## Sar: Shift to right

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)
    (Mov 'rax 42)   # ...0000 0010 1010
    (Sar 'rax 1)    # ...0000 0010 101 (delete 1 bit on right & add 1 bit of '' on the left)s
    (Ret)   # -> ...0000 0001 0101 -> 21
  )
)
```

## Jmp

It jumps right away. It doesn't check the Zero Flag after `Cmp`.

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)

    (Mov 'rax 42)
    (Jmp 'l1)
    (Mov 'rax 10)

    (Label 'l1)
    (Ret)
  )
)
```

## Je (Jz): Jump if equal

It stands for Jump equal or Jump zero

After a `Cmp`, if the Zero Flag was set to 1 then jump.

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)

    (Mov 'rax 42)
    (Cmp 'rax 42) # 42 = 42? true or 1
    (Jz 'foo)     # is ZF 1? yes, jump to 'foo
    (Mov 'rax 2)

    (Label 'foo)
    (Ret)         # -> rax = 42
  )
)
```

## Jne (Jnz): Jump if not equal or not zero

After a `Cmp`, check if the ZF is 0 then jump

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)

    (Mov 'rax 42)
    (Cmp 'rax 42) # 42 = 42? true or 1
    (Jnz 'foo)    # is ZF 0? no, so no jump
    (Mov 'rax 2)  # rax = 2

    (Label 'foo)
    (Ret)         # -> rax = 2
  )
)
```

## Jl, Jle, Jg, Jge

After `Cmp`, checks if ZF was set to 1 then jumps.

- `Jl`: less than
- `Jle`: less or equal than
- `Jg`: greater than
- `Jge`: greater or equal than

## Flags

- ZF is set when the result is 0
- SF is set when the most-significant bit (MSB) of the result is set
- CF is set when a bit was set beyond the MSB
- OF is set when one of the conditions met:

1. The MSB of each input is set and the MSB of the result is not set
2. The MSB of each input si not set and the MSB of the result is set

## Push and Pop

Sometimes we want to remember values or use the same register in other places. So we push it into the stack.

The amount of `Push` must be the same amount of `Pop` otherwise memory leak error.

**Note:** The very first address in the stack is the `Ret`. What `(Ret)` does is pop the next register in the stack (which must be the `Ret` address otherwise error) and jumps to it.

**Note:** `rsp` is the register that points to the top of the stack. When doing a `Push` to the stack, the `rsp` decrements/points to the next 8 bytes (64 bit) block of memory and the new value is stored there.

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)

    (Mov 'rax 42)
    (Push 'rax)   # push the value of rax into the stack
    (Mov 'rax 0)  # reuse rax for other purposes
    ; ... loop    # we could reuse rax inside the loop

    (Pop 'rax)    # the number of push must be = number of pops
    (Ret)         # rax = 42
  )
)
```

Another exmple:

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)

    (Mov 'rax 'rsp)   # rax points to the top of the stack
    (Push 0)          # push to the stack and rsp points to the next 8 bytes of block
    (Sub 'rax 'rsp)   # it turns out rax = 8 bytes
    (pop 'rbx)        # pop the 0 from the stack

    (Ret)             # -> 8 bytes
  )
)
```

## Pointer

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)

    (Mov 'rax 'rsp)
    (Push 0)
    (Push 1)
    (Sub 'rax 'rsp)
    (Pop 'rcx)
    (Pop 'rcx)

    (Ret)
  )
)
```

## Call

a86

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)

    (Call 'f)   # jump to the label 'f
    # jump here after return
    (Add 'rax 1)
    (Ret)


    (Label 'f)
    (Mov 'rax 41)
    (Ret)
  )s
)
```

ret = pop & jump


## Lea

`Lea` means give me the address of this.

**Note:** `Lea rcx 'g` + `Push 'rcx` + `Jmp 'f` + `Label 'g` is equivalent to `Call 'f`. Check the difference with the prev example. 

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)

    (Lea 'rcx 'g)     # rcx = address of 'g
    (Push 'rcx)       # push 'g into the stack
    (Jmp 'f)

    (Label 'g)        # jump here after 'f returns
    (Add 'rax 1)      # rax = 42
    (Ret)             # pops the Ret and jumps to it (terminate the program)

    (Label 'f)
    (Mov 'rax 41)     # rax = 41 
  )
)
```

## Cmov*: Conditional Move

Move after a comparision 

```racket
#lang racket
(require a86)
(asm-interp
  (prog
    (Global 'entry)
    (Label 'entry)

    (Mov 'rax 10)     # rax = 10
    (Mov 'rcx 100)    # rcx = 100

    (Cmp 'rax 10)     # true
    (Cmovz 'rax 'rcx) # Cmp was true? yes, then rax = 100

    (Ret) # -> 100
  )
)
```

Instruction sets:

- Cmovz: if comparison was `equal`, then move
- Cmove: ...
- Cmovnz: if comparison was `not equal`, then move
- Cmovne: ...
- Cmovl: `less than`
- Cmovle:  `less than or equal`
- Cmovg: `greater than`
- Cmovge: `greater than or equal`
- Cmovo
- Cmovno
- Cmovc
- Cmovnc
