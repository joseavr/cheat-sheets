# Beta reduction
- call the function/apply the left value (e1) to the function ont the right(e2)
- if left value (e1) is not function, then we cannot beta reduce hence, we are in beta normal form
- call by name and call by value are rules of precendence as to what ot beta reduce first

## Call by Name
we call the left first

## Call by Value
call the right first

(Lx.Ly.y) (x (La.a a) ((Lc.c)d) )
call by name is always going to be left first (do not eval arugment until you have to)
call by value is right first (argument first)
